# _Feature Engineering and Selection_ Figures

This directory _will_ contain png files of the images used in the physical copy of the book. 

Figures for the on-line copy are in SVG format and, in some cases, are rendered using interactive javascript files. These are vector graphics and are hihger resolution than the png files and can be saved by right-clicking on the image.
