Code and Data Sets for [_Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models_](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/) by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson (2019). 

Right now, the content is a _beta version_ that has undergone outside review but we'd like to get comments before finalizing it. It has *not* gone through copyediting to date. 

The repo currently contains:

* a [place to ask questions or make comments](https://github.com/topepo/FES/issues) about the beta version of the book. Please help us make it better!
* `Data_Sets` directory contains all of the new data sets used in the text. 


Other directories _will_ contain code that reproduces the analyses in the book. Some analyses are contained in since subdirectories or files while others are split up (as is best for each case). Each analysis has a list of required R packages and enumerates the package versions that were used for the analyses contained in the text. Most analyses use visualizations and tables that are consistent with the on-line version and are interactive where possible. 

These code directories will be available as we finish the text. 


For questions or comments, please file an issue.
