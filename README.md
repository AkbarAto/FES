# _Feature Engineering and Selection_

The repository is for the text "Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models" by Kuhn and and Johnson and published by Chapman & Hall/CRC (who holds the copyright). 

Right now, the content is a _beta version_ that has undergone outside review but we'd like to get comments before finalizing it. It has *not* gone through copyediting to date. 

The repo currently contains:

* a [place to ask questions or make comments](https://github.com/topepo/FES/issues) about the beta version of the book. Please help us make it better!

Once the physical copy is released, the repo **will** contain:

* data sets
* code to reproduce the analyses
* figures
* errata (physical copy) and changelog (HTML copy)

It will not contain:

* the sources to create the book
* the text files
* code to create illustrative figures (e.g. not contain data analysis results)
